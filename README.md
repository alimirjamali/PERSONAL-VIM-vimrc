# About this repository
[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) is a popular free and open source multi-purpose text editor. 
This repository contains my personal [vimrc](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file) file.
It was created as the *default vimrc Example* which was suggested in [vimtutor](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial) and was shipped with my Vim installation.

## Background
I had been a [GNU nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano) user since 2017.
GNU nano was my 1st choice of terminal based text editor once I started using POSIX like environments.
It'd found it the easiest, most user friendly text editor, both for editing configuration files and for writing simple short programs.

At the beginning of 2017, I needed a more powerful, highly configurable text editor. Vim was the most obvious choice, recommended by many friends[(1)](http://amirsamimi.ir/vim/).

## How to use
You could simply enjoy my *vimrc* file with following command:

	vim -u vimrc

Or you could copy it as your default .vimrc file.

# License
Vim has it's own license, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License. Please read *uganda.txt* for more information.
